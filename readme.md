A lightweight Nano Node implementation designed for wallets and other services, built to be compatible with Nano's official reference implementation.

## Goals

- Provide a lightweight Nano node implementation for client-side (browsers, mobile apps) and server-side (Node.js) environments.
- Offer an alternative to public RPC servers for accessing the state of the Nano ledger.
- Ensure compatibility with the official RPC protocol and reference implementation of Nano.

## Status

The node implementation is currently under heavy development and has not yet reached a stable release. It has not been audited and should not be used in production environments.
